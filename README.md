Title: Weather Website

Description of Project: With our weather website, we are hoping to create a platform that provides more reliable weather information. We acknowledge that many of the current weather
applications have intrinsic difficulties in providing localized data, especially for users who live in distant or smaller communities. By putting in place a system that gives 
specificity and dependability in weather forecasting priority, we will close this gap. Our weather app offers a wide range of features for convenient access to precise weather
forecasts, all of which are carefully designed to meet the varied demands of our users. The home page functions as the focal point and is enhanced with a modern navigation bar
that leads users to other areas with ease. Here, users can quickly navigate between the day-by-day and hourly forecast sections, which provide in-depth insights into future
weather patterns, and the main page, which provides real-time weather updates like temperature, wind speed, sunrise and sunset times, and more. Users can also visit the
About section to learn more about our team, the history of the weather website, and our dedication to providing accurate weather information. The help page is a helpful resource
that helps users navigate the website, set location settings, access FAQs, comprehend weather icons, and personalize their experience by allowing them to customize website
options. The forecast page, which provides users with a thorough summary of the weather conditions for their selected location, is the central component of our service. Here,
visitors can explore location-specific information such as time, date, and temperature forecasts, with an emphasis on the weather patterns for the upcoming few days. Weather
conditions, such as bright, partly overcast, or rainy, are clearly displayed visually, allowing users to plan their activities and make decisions with ease.
Beyond just functionality, our dedication to user happiness includes a smooth and simple user interface that makes it easy and pleasurable to obtain reliable weather information.
With the help of our weather app, users can confidently navigate through shifting weather patterns. 

Description of Target Browsers: Our target browser for this application is currently someone going on the internet and opening the website on their browser. As our web page is currently 
designed and laid out, it is the most efficient and easy to read when using a web browser. However, in the future, we would love to explore the possibility of creating an application
that is also accessible through iOS and Android.
